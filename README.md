# Detection-of-ML-behavior-changes

The goal of this project was to be able to detect and catagorize attacks thaht have happened on an ML machine. In this project we did an FGSM input attack and a backdoor attack and looked at the model statistics to see if there was anything noticable about the attack thaht could be used to identify the attack.
